Put any notes for us here:

I took a 30 minute break and allotted that time into my requirements. I will be creating a seperate branch called goingfurther where i will take some extra time to add some styles and animations as well as completing the challenges, I know this won't count but it is a fun project and I hate leaving it unfinished. During the initial 2 hours I mainly rushed through getting the bones of the app working and I let the clock get the best of me in terms of logging all of my commits, I did however comment out most of the processes I was working on to make sure it was understood what I was trying to do. I am extremely unsatisfied with the current  UI/UX state of the application, this is a process I fine tune as the app builds but it's hard to jam it all into four hours and I was primarily focused on getting the app working. I had a lot of fun with this challenge and look forward to hearing from you.
